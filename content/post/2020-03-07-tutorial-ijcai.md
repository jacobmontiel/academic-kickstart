Our tutorial **Machine learning for data streams with scikit-multiflow** has been accepted for presentation in [IJCAI-PRICAI 2020](https://ijcai20.org/)!

#### Abstract

Data stream mining has gained a lot of attention in recent years as an exciting research topic. However, there is still a gap between the pure research proposals and the practical applications to real-world machine learning problems. The main goal of this tutorial is to introduce attendees to data stream mining theory and practice. We will use the scikit-multiflow framework to illustrate concepts and also to demonstrate how data stream mining can be easily performed in Python using scikit-multiflow.
