I am participating at the "Model life cycle" round table at DataJob Paris 2019. A great opportunity to talk about stream learning and its relevance on real-world applications. Companies in multiple-sectors are actively deploying machine learning models into production, but that is not the end of the story, models need to be monitored and maintained. Furthermore, in multiple real-world applications **data changes over time**, turning trained models obsolete.
