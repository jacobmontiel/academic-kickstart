I am participating in the *Model life-cycle* round-table at DataJob Paris 2019. A great opportunity to talk about stream learning and its relevance on real-world applications. Companies in multiple sectors are actively deploying machine learning models into production, but that is not the end of the story, models need to be monitored and maintained. Furthermore, in multiple real-world applications **data changes over time**, turning trained models obsolete.

Participants:

- Heloïse Nonne | Head of Data Science & Engineering | ITNOVEM, SNCF expertise center
- Renan Borne | Chief Architect | AXA-IM
- John Whitbeck | Head of Machine Learning | Liftoff
- Grégoire Martinon | Senior Data Scientist | Quantmetry
- Jacob Montiel | Research fellow | University of Waikato
