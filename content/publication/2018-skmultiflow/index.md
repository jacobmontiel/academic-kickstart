abstract: "scikit-multiflow is a framework for learning from data streams and multi-output learning in Python. Conceived to serve as a platform to encourage the democratization of stream learning research, it provides multiple state-of-the-art learning methods, data generators and evaluators for different stream learning problems, including single-output, multi-output and multi-label. scikit-multiflow builds upon popular open source frameworks including scikit-learn, MOA and MEKA. Development follows the FOSS principles. Quality is enforced by complying with PEP8 guidelines, using continuous integration and functional testing."
