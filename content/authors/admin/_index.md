I am a Research Fellow in the [Machine Learning Group](https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/~ml/) at the [University of Waikato](https://www.waikato.ac.nz/). I am the lead developer and maintainer of [scikit-multiflow](https://scikit-multiflow.github.io/), a machine learning framework for multi-label/multi-output stream data.

I worked at GE Aviation as Tech Lead in the development of embedded software for Diagnostics and Prognostics of Airborne Systems.
